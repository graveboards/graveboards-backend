         * Backreferences like `\1`: `r"\\\d+"`
         * Named capture groups: `r"\(\?P<.*?>"`
         * Other fancy constructs: `r"\(\?[^:=!#]"`
        
        
        Suspicious patterns are also disallowed:
        
         * Classic ReDoS: `r"\(\s*\.\*\s*\)\+"`
         * Also suspicious: `r"\(\s*\.\*\s*\)\+"`
         * Nested greedy quantifiers: `r"\(\s*.+\*\s*\)\+"`
         * Repeated `(.*){2+}`: `"\(\s*\.\*\s*\)\{2,}"`
         * Multiple chained `.*`: `r"(\.\*){2,}"`
