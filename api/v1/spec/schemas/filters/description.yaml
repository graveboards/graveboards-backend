    ### Filter
    
    Object of fields and conditions
    

    Supports dicts of relational operators, membership operators, and null check:
    
     * **eq**, **neq**, **gt**, **lt**, **gte**, **lte**
     * **in**, **not_in**
     * **is_null**
    
    Alternatively, supports shorthand via direct values:
    
     * *value is not null* -> **eq**
     * *value is null* -> **is_null**
    
    Nested objects can be used to filter related entities, applying the same rules recursively.
