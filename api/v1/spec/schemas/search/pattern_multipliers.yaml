        ### Pattern matching relevance multipliers

        This object defines numeric multipliers that adjust the relevance score of search results
        based on how closely the search terms match specific patterns in text fields

        Each property represents a different type of string match for each term provided:

         * **exact**: The full string matches the term exactly
         * **prefix**: The string starts with the term
         * **suffix**: The string ends with the term
         * **substring**: The string contains the term anywhere within it
        
        
        To exclude a pattern from influencing the search entirely, set it to **null**.
        This differs from setting a multiplier to **0**,
        which disables scoring but still allows the pattern to affect filtering.
        For instance, disabling the **substring** pattern by setting it to **null** ensures that maps containing
        your searched terms in any field matching that pattern are excluded â€”
        unless of course those same terms match other enabled pattern(s) (e.g., **prefix**)
