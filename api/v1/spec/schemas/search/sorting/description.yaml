    ### An ordered array of sorting rules that determines how the search results should be sorted
    
    Each item defines a **field** to sort by and the **order**
    
    
    You can provide multiple sorting rules and they will be applied in sequence (i.e., if there are ties in
    the results with the first sorting layer, the second layer will be applied to those tied results, and so on)
